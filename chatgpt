I need a Salesforce Lightning Web Component, named horseCards, that displays a list of records within experience cloud.

The component should have the title "Horses". Subtitle should read "

We will display a list of Horse__c records. The Horse__c records will be grouped by Partnership__c. Group using the Accordion lightning design system component. 

For the Horse__c records, use the card component. An image of the horse should be on the left side of the card, the image is stored in the Key_Photo__c field. On the right side of the card list these attributes: Name, Status__c, Location__c, Sex__c. 

Above the list, add a container where the user can filter the records displayed. Add a checkbox button group to filter by Horse.Status__c.
